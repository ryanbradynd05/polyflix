Polyglot Movie Manager  -  [Coding 15](http://coding15.com)

I've wanted to write an application to manage my growing movie collection for a while, but I can never seem to find the time. So, as a sort of resolution for 2015, I'm going to write that application by spending at least 15 minutes each day working on it. The application will consist of a SPA (single page app) web UI that connects via REST to a server component that will do the heavy lifting.

Now that I have a (very) rough outline of the app, the first order of business is picking a programming language to write it in. Most media manager applications that I've seen are written in Python, while most of my experience is in Java and JavaScript. I'm sure I could just write the app in Node and Ember.js, the stack that I currently use at work. But, I thought it might be more fun and a better learning experience to try to write the app in multiple languages at once. I'd like to spend some time with some other languages that I've either used in the past or have been wanting to try. So, this project will give me that opportunity.

My ultimate wish-list of languages is below. I will most likely end up adding or dropping languages from this list. But, these are the ones I am interested in trying as of now.

* Ember
* Angular
* React
* Dart
* Node
* Java
* Python
* Rails (Ruby)
* Scala
* Go
* Rust

I'm not as good at or interested in the CSS side of things, so I'm only going to write SASS for that part as that is what I'm used to. I'll probably rely pretty heavily on Bootstrap for styling and hope the UI comes out decent in modern (non-IE) browsers. Once I get further along, I may end up revisiting the CSS.
